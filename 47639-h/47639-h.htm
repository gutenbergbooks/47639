<p class="p0">HE RANGE of coyotes and wolves in the United States to-day is
confined mainly to the immense area west of the Mississippi River.
Wolves, however, have been so materially reduced in numbers west
of the one-hundredth meridian that except for those drifting into the
United States from the northern States of Mexico, they are the cause of
little concern. The areas now most heavily infested with wolves are
in Alaska, eastern Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and Michigan. A few r of these animals are found also
in northern Louisiana and eastward along the Gulf coastal area into
Mississippi. Coyotes, on the other hand, exist in all the Western
States, as well as in the Mid-Western States above listed as inhabited
by wolves. They have also been reported in Orleans County, N. Y.,
and in southeastern Alabama where introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why Control<br />
Is Necessary</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Coyotes and wolves</span> make serious inroads on the stocks of sheep
and lambs, cattle, pigs, and poultry, as well as on the wild game
mammals and the ground-nesting and insectivorous
birds of the country. Wherever these predatory animals
occur in large numbers, they are a source of worry and
loss to stockmen, farmers, and sportsmen because of
their destructiveness to wild and domestic animals. The coyote is
by far the most persistent of the predators of the western range
country; and moreover, it is a further menace because it is a carrier of
rabies, or hydrophobia. This disease was prevalent in Nevada,
California, Utah, Idaho, and eastern Oregon in 1916 and 1917, and
later in Washington and in southern Colorado. Since this widespread
outbreak, sporadic cases of rabid coyotes have occurred each year
in the Western States. The coyote has also been found to be a
carrier of tularemia, a disease of wild rabbits and other rodents that is
transmissible and sometimes fatal to human beings.</p>

<p>Much of the country inhabited by coyotes and wolves is purely
agricultural and contains vast grazing areas, and a large percentage
of the food of the animals of those areas consists of the mutton, beef,
pork, and poultry produced by the stockman and farmer, and the wild
game that needs to be conserved. It is a matter of great importance,
therefore, to the Nation&rsquo;s livestock-producing sections, as well as
to the conservationist&rsquo;s plan of game protection or game propagation,
that coyotes and wolves be controlled in areas where they are destructive.
Trapping has been found to be one of the most effective
methods of capturing these animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strategy<br />
Required</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Every wild animal</span> possesses some form of defense against danger
or harm to itself. With wolves and coyotes this is shown in their
acute sense of smell, alert hearing, and keen eyesight.
To trap these animals successfully, one must work to
defeat these highly developed senses when placing traps,
and success in doing so will come only with a full knowledge
of the habits of the two predators and after repeated experiments with
trap sets. Of the two animals, possibly the wolf is the more difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">» 3 «</a></span>
trap. It is cunning, and as it matures from the yearling stage to the
adult its cleverness at times becomes uncanny. Individual coyotes
also possess this trait, particularly old animals that have been
persistently hunted and trapped with crude methods.</p>

<p>The steel trap, in sizes 3 and 4 for coyotes and sizes 4K and 14 for
wolves (114 in Alaska), is recommended for capturing these large
predators. Steel traps have been used in this country by many
generations of trappers, and although deemed by many persons to be
inhumane, no better or more practical device has yet been invented
to take their place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scent Posts</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On the open range</span> coyotes and wolves have what are commonly
referred to as &ldquo;scent posts,&rdquo; or places where they come to urinate.
The animals usually establish these posts along their
runways on stubble of range grasses, on bushes, or
possibly on some old bleached-out carcasses. Where
ground conditions are right for good tracking, these scent posts may
be detected from the toenail scratches on the ground made by the
animals after they have urinated. This habit of having scent posts
and of scratching is similar to that noted in dogs. As wolves and
coyotes pass over their travel ways, they generally stop at these posts,
invariably voiding fresh urine and occasionally excreta also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where to<br />
Set Traps</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Finding</span> these scent posts is of prime importance, for it is at such
points that traps should be set. If such posts 'can not be found,
then one can be readily established, if the travel way of
the coyote or wolf has been definitely ascertained, by dropping
scent of the kind to be described later on a few clusters
of weeds, spears of grass, or stubble of low brush.
The trap should then be set at this point. Any number of such scent
stations can thus be placed along a determined wolf or coyote travel
way.</p>

<p>Time consumed in finding a wolf or coyote scent post is well spent,
for the success of a trap set depends upon its location. Coyotes
and wolves can not be caught unless traps are set and concealed where
the animals will step into them. If traps are placed where the animals
are not accustomed to stop on their travel ways, the chances
are that they will pass them by on the run. Even if a wolf or a coyote
should detect the scent, the fact that it is in an unnatural place
may arouse the suspicion of the animal and cause it to become shy and
make a detour. Often the fresh tracks of shod horses along wolf and
coyote runways are sufficient to cause the predators to leave the
trail for some distance. A lone wolf is much more cautious than a
pack of wolves running together.</p>

<p>Travel ways of coyotes and wolves are confined to open and more
or less broken country. In foraging for food over these runways
the animals may use trails of cattle or sheep, canyons, old wood
roads, dry washes, low saddles on watershed divides, or even highways
in thinly settled areas. Any one of these places, or any combination
of them, may be a wolf or coyote runway. Wolves have been known
to cover a circuitous route of more than a hundred miles in an established
runway. It is in such country that their scent posts should be
looked for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">» 5 «</a></span></p>

<p>Places where carcasses of animals killed by wolves and coyotes or
of animals that have died from natural causes have lain a long time
offer excellent spots for setting traps, for wolves and coyotes often
revisit these carcasses. It is always best to set the traps a few yards
away from the carcasses at weeds, bunches of grass, or low stubble of
bushes. Other good situations are at the intersection of two or more
trails, around old bedding grounds of sheep, and at water holes on the
open range. Ideal places for wolf or coyote traps are points 6 to 8
inches from the bases of low clusters of weeds or grasses along a
trail used as a runway.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 405px;">
<a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a>

<div class="fig_caption"><div class="tdr smaller">B19743; B24415</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Burying the traps: A, A shoulder of dirt should be built up around and under the pan
as a foundation for the trap pad, which is shown in place; B, trap completely bedded, springs and
jaws covered, and pan unobstructed, ready for trap pad to be put in place</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Setting<br />
the Traps</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Traps</span> used should be clean, with no foreign odor. In making
a set, a hole the length and width of the trap with jaws open is dug
with a trowel, a sharpened piece of angle iron, or a prospector&rsquo;s
pick. While digging, the trapper stands or kneels
on a &ldquo;setting cloth,&rdquo; about 3 feet square, made of canvas
or of a piece of sheep or calf hide. If canvas is used, the
human scent may be removed by previously burying it in an old
manure pile. The livestock scent acquired in this process is usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">» 6 «</a></span>
strong enough to counteract any scent later adhering to the setting
cloth and likely to arouse suspicion. The dirt removed from the
hole dug to bed the trap is placed on the setting cloth. The trap is
then dropped into the hole and firmly bedded so as to rest perfectly
level.</p>

<p>Instead of using digging tools, some hunters bed the trap where
the ground is loose, as in sandy loam, by holding it at its base and
with a circular motion working it slowly into the ground even with
the surface and then removing the dirt from under the pan before
placing the trap pad to be described later. An important advantage
of this method is that there is less disturbance of the ground around
the scent post than when tools are used, for the secret of setting a
trap successfully is to leave the ground as natural as it was before
the trap was concealed. A double trap set, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1, B</a>,
may be used and is often preferred to a single set for coyotes.</p>

<p>The trap may be left unanchored or anchored. Either draghooks
may be attached to a chain (preferably 6 feet long) fastened by a
swivel to the trap base or to a spring, and all buried underneath, or
a steel stake pin (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1, A and C</a>) may be used, attached by a swivel
to a 6-foot chain fastened to the base or a spring of the trap. If a
stake pin is used, it should be driven full length into the ground
near the right-hand spring of the trap, with the trigger and pan
directly toward the operator. Anchoring the trap is the preferred
method, because animals caught are obtained without loss of time
and because other animals are not driven out of their course by one
of their kind dragging about a dangling, clanking trap, often the
case where drag hooks are used.</p>

<p>The next stage (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2, A and B</a>) is the careful burying of the trap
and building up of a so-called shoulder around and under the pan.
This should be so built that, when it is completed, the shape of the
ground within the jaws of the trap represents an inverted cone, in
order to give a foundation for the pan cover, commonly called the
&ldquo;trap pad.&rdquo; The trap pad may be made of canvas, of old &ldquo;slicker
cloth,&rdquo; or even of a piece of ordinary wire fly screen cut into the
shape shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2, A</a>. The trap pad to be effective must
contain no foreign odor that might arouse the suspicion of wolf or
coyote.</p>

<p>In placing the trap pad over the pan and onto the shoulders of
the dirt built up for carrying it, the utmost care must be taken to
see that no rock, pebble, or dirt slips under the pan, which would
prevent the trap from springing. With the trap pad in place (<a href="#fig2">fig.
2, A</a>), the entire trap is carefully covered with the remaining portion
of earth on the setting cloth (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3, B</a>).</p>

<p>Cover traps at least half an inch deep with dry dust if possible.
It is well to have the covered surface over the trap a little lower than
the surrounding ground, for a wolf or a coyote is then less apt to
scratch and expose the trap without springing it. Furthermore, the
animal will throw more weight on a foot placed in a depression, and
thus is more likely to be caught deeper on the foot and with a firmer
grip. All surplus earth on the setting cloth not needed for covering
the trap should be taken a good distance away and scattered evenly
on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">» 7 «</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 406px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Completed trap sets, with ground made to blend again with surroundings. The small
stone in the foreground of A and the triangular stick in B serve to break the natural gait of the
animal and cause it to step directly over it onto the pan of the trap; C, place the scent on side of
brush or weed that is nearest the trap</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">» 8 «</a></span></p>

<p>A few drops of scent are now applied (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3, C</a>) to the weed, cluster
of grass, or stubble used as the scent post. A scent tested and
successfully used by Government hunters is made as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scenting</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Put into</span> a bottle the urine and the gall of a wolf or a coyote,
depending on which is to be trapped, and also the anal glands, which
are situated under the skin on either side of the vent
and resemble small pieces of bluish fat. If these glands
can not be readily found, the whole anal parts may be
used. To every 3 ounces of the mixture add 1 ounce of glycerin, to
give it body and to prevent too rapid evaporation, and 1 grain of
corrosive sublimate to keep it from spoiling.</p>

<p>Let the mixture stand several days, then shake well and scatter
a few drops on weeds or ground 6 or 8 inches from the place where the
trap is set. The farther from the travelway the trap is set, the
more scent will be needed. A little of the scent should be rubbed on
the trapper&rsquo;s gloves and shoe soles to conceal the human odor.</p>

<p>If the animals become &ldquo;wise&rdquo; to this kind of scent, an effective
fish scent may be prepared in the following way:</p>

<p>Grind the flesh of sturgeon, eels, trout, suckers, carp, or other oily
variety of fish in a sausage mill, place in strong tin or iron cans, and
leave in a warm place of even temperature to decompose thoroughly.
Provide each can with a small vent to allow the escape of gas (otherwise
there is danger of explosion), but screen the aperture with a
fold of cloth to prevent flies depositing eggs, as the scent seems to
lose much of its quality if many maggots develop. This scent may
be used within 3 days after it is prepared, but it is more lasting and
penetrating after a lapse of 30 days. It is also very attractive to
livestock, and its use on heavily stocked ranges is not recommended,
as cattle are attracted to such scent stations and will spring the
traps.</p>

<p>An excellent system for a hunter to follow is to commence with
a quantity of ground fish placed in large iron containers, similar to
a milk can. As the original lot is used on the trap line, it should be
replenished by adding more ground fresh fish. The addition from
time to time of new material seems to improve the quality of the
scent mixture.</p>

<p>Where no moisture has fallen, rescenting of scent posts need be
done only every four or five days. In wet weather every third day
is good practice. For dropping the scent it is best to use a 2 to 4
ounce shaker-corked bottle.</p>

<p>The actual trapping of a wolf or a coyote by the method here
described occurs when the animal comes over its runway and is
attracted to the &ldquo;post&rdquo; by the scent that has been dropped. In
approaching the spot for a smell the animal invariably puts a foot on
the concealed pan; the jaws are thus released and the foot is securely
held. The place where a wolf or a coyote has thus been caught
affords an excellent location for a reset after the animal has been
removed from the trap. This is due to the natural scent dropped
by the animal while in the trap.</p>

<p>It is advisable always to wear gloves while setting traps and to use
them for no other purpose than for trap setting.</p>
